# Introduction
This library has been my learning experience for a period of time, and I have made countless mistakes and still haven't learned well in many aspects. The basic learning process is described here.  
## ROS learning  
In my experience, ROS does not require deliberate learning. What we need to do is learn how to use ROS. Therefore, as long as we start to understand the usage of ROS and understand the mechanism of ROS messages, we can handle the vast majority of tasks. The rest only require us to learn while using ROS. 

Here are some links related to ROS learning：

## Opencv and PCl  
These two libraries do not need to be deliberately studied, just learned during use  

## How to use the current repository  
This library is actually pieced together by many corresponding libraries, using many libraries, resulting in a relatively awkward situation. And the implementation effect is not particularly good, in fact, it may be an essential starting point design issue, and the first step is to build the corresponding simulation environment.
