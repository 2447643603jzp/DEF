# Introduction
This library has been my learning experience for a period of time, and I have made countless mistakes and still haven't learned well in many aspects. The basic learning process is described here.  
## ROS learning  
In my experience, ROS does not require deliberate learning. What we need to do is learn how to use ROS. Therefore, as long as we start to understand the usage of ROS and understand the mechanism of ROS messages, we can handle the vast majority of tasks. The rest only require us to learn while using ROS. 

Here are some links related to ROS learning：
